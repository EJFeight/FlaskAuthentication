# Native Flask Authentication
Flask Login Sample Project

The purpose of this project is to show how to use the flask_login library to perform user
authentication in a simple Flask application.

I have spent many hours watching YouTube videos, reading tutorials, and trying code samples
that did not work. In addition to that, almost all of these want you to use an ORM. I am not going
to get into the debate over the benefits of an ORM over simple database queries. Personally I am
more comfortable with direct database interaction than I am with the overhead and learning curve
required to use an ORM that forces me into a data structure that I have little to no control over. I
realize this is a very contested topic and having stated my preferences I will end my rant. At the
end of the day it comes down to a personal choice. As such I have implemented this with a simple
Python dictionary. Feel free to replace this with anything you choose.

The bulk of this work is based on documentation and source code for the flask_login library which
can be found at:
https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login

The application is pretty “bare bones.” I have added comments in the app.py file that will hopefully
explain all you need to know to get native Flask authentication running on your project. As this is
not intended as an example of HTML5 of Jinja templates, the html files are very basic with no comments.
The idea was just to provide a framework for testing the Flask application.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me at: ejfeight@hotmail.com.
I’m not an expert by any means, but I would appreciate your feedback and I will be happy to provide
any assistance I can.

I hope you find this helpful.
